Language game is a game where the user will try to guess the language's English name given its name in its traditional script. For example, fran√ßais is French.

As of March 31, 2023, we have created a successful prototype. We do intend to add more features such as implementing fictional languages such as mayhaps Klingon and even programming languages saying "Hello World!" However, we are busy with school and will continue this project when possible.

The CSV we used for non-fictional languages comes from the user github.com/forxer in the repository https://github.com/forxer/languages-list/tree/master/src
